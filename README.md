# ChatGPT-by-API

## Project Description
ChatGPT-by-API is a web service that allows users to chat with an AI model using the OpenAI API. Unlike the original ChatGPT, it doesn't require a server to function. The service directly calls the OpenAI API from the user's browser. The API key and conversation history are saved locally in the userâ€™s browser.

## Features
- Conversations with ChatGPT using the OpenAI API
- Client-side application, without the need of a server
- API key and conversation history are saved in the user's browser

## Technologies Used
- OpenAI API for generating AI responses
- React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Vite, a build tool that focuses on speed and simplicity
- TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- localForage, a JavaScript library for storing key-value pairs in a browser's local storage

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the OpenAI API team for enabling me to build this service.
